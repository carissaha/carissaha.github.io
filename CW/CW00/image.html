<p>Chinese New Year 2025, also known as the Lunar New Year, marks the beginning of the Year of the Wood Snake. 
    The festival, deeply rooted in Chinese tradition, is celebrated with family reunions, festive meals, dragon and lion dances, and the giving of red envelopes (hongbao) for good luck. 
    As a symbol of wisdom, transformation, and intuition, the Snake is believed to bring a year of strategic growth and adaptability. 
    The holiday lasts 15 days, culminating in the Lantern Festival, where glowing lanterns light up the night sky to welcome prosperity and new beginnings. </p>
