        3) After reloading a few times, the number of times visited changes and the last visit. 
        At first it was none, then 1, then 2.<br><br>
        4) If I visited the page twice, it says there are 2 cookies.<br><br>
        5) Now it says "There is no record when you last visited this page previously".<br><br>
        6) The other cookies that my browser has stored are from youtube.com, gsu.edu, amazon.com, webex.com, and googleadservices.com.
        Around 60% has been from my web work.<br><br>
        7) Nothing visually changed, but if there is output before the code for the cookie, the cookie may not be set correctly. <br><br>
        9) Clicking it leads to session-cookies-3.php which shows "Authorization Failure!" and "Please log in before accessing this page."<br><br>
        10) It does the same thing, stating authorization failure and to try again.<br><br>
        11) Even if the user doesn't enter a correct password or any other data, this random number cookie will still be set.
        The random number cookie and the session cookie serve different purposes. 
        The session cookie tracks the user's session state, while the random number cookie stores a random number and exists even if the user is not logged in or doesn't have a session.<br><br>
        12) The name I see is PHPSESSID for the session cookie.<br><br>
        13) Yes, it says "Authorization Succeeded" and "You have logged in previously, so processing can continue on this page."<br><br>
        14) session-cookies-1 sends the password to session-cookies-2 for verification. Here, cookies are used to track visit history (first visit, last visit, number of visits).
        session-cookies-2 checks if the session variable is already set. If it is set, the user has previously logged in successfully. If not, the script verifies the password.
        If the password is correct, authorized is set to ok, but if incorrect, the session variable is not set, denying access. session-cookies-3 checks if the session variable is set to ok.
        If it is, the user is logged in. If not, access is denied. <br><br>
